Date: 15-March-2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to maintain the integrity of each modules architecture

## Decision

We will use ArchUnit to enforce the architectural boundaries between packages

## Consequences

The code stays decoupled and easier to maintain with the domain as it's core
